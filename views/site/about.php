			 		<p>Every child is blessed with Multiple Intelligences, interests and innate talents.
					Our job as parents and teachers is to tap their potential by allowing them to discover these with several opportunities and experiences. These explorations help them build a strong self esteem, that makes them curious, confident and eager for life!</p>
					<p>At ‘Pari’s Coaching Classes, we support the child's individuality and help them realize their potential by integrating Traditional as well as Modern educational ways with a stimulating and enriching environment.</p>
					<p>Our 22 years of experience taught us to follow the Multiple Intelligence Approach and is inspired by the best educational practices across the globe.</p>
